\usage{
new_seas_block(seas_call = "seas(x = x, x11 = list())", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{seas_call}{String containing the complete seas() call (default: "seas(x = x, x11 = list())")}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to new_transform_block}
}
\description{
Performs seasonal adjustment using X-13ARIMA-SEATS via the seasonal package.
This block introduces a novel pattern in blockr: returning a statistical model
object rather than data, enabling downstream blocks to consume the model.
}
\details{
Features:
\itemize{
\item Height-adjustable ACE editor with resizing handle
\item Comprehensive autocomplete for seas() parameters and values
\item Submit button with validation (changes applied only on submit)
\item Enhanced syntax highlighting for R code
\item Error handling with user-friendly notifications
\item Optional xreg and xtrans inputs for external regressors
}

The block accepts three inputs:
\itemize{
\item x: The main time series (required)
\item xreg: External regressors (optional)
\item xtrans: Transformation variables (optional)
}

When xreg or xtrans are provided, they can be referenced in the seas_call,
for example: "seas(x = x, xreg = xreg, regression.variables = c('td', 'easter'))"
}
